I enjoy using Visual Studio as an all-in-one IDE for Windows programming, but when I’m writing code for the web, I prefer simpler text editors. I’ve tried many, and eventually settled on [Notepad++][1] sometime last year.

What I really like about [Notepad++][1] (besides the fact that it’s free) is how lightweight it is. It fires up instantly, just like classic Notepad does, and at the same time includes all the features that I want, including syntax highlighting, auto-completion, brace matching and auto-indentation, tabs, support for regular expressions, macros etc.

![Notepad++ - Ruby Blue][2]

As I was working on a project this morning, it occurred to me that I should mention a custom syntax highlighting style called [Ruby Blue][3] that I’ve been using (image above, courtesy of the author). It’s quite surprising how beneficial a good font and syntax highlighting scheme can be, and [Ruby Blue,][3] coupled with [DejaVu Sans Mono][4] or [Consolas,][5] works very well for me.

The Ruby Blue style is also [available for Vim and TextMate.][6]

Do you have a favorite text editor, monospace font, and syntax highlighting scheme?
