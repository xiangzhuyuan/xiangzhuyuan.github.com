from his blog:   <a href="http://kunal.kundaje.net/2007/07/notepad-and-the-ruby-blue-style/">http://kunal.kundaje.net/2007/07/notepad-and-the-ruby-blue-style/</a>

I enjoy using Visual Studio as an all-in-one IDE for Windows programming, but when I’m writing code for the web, I prefer simpler text editors. I’ve tried many, and eventually settled on <a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/">Notepad++</a> sometime last year.

What I really like about <a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/">Notepad++</a> (besides the fact that it’s free) is how lightweight it is. It fires up instantly, just like classic Notepad does, and at the same time includes all the features that I want, including syntax highlighting, auto-completion, brace matching and auto-indentation, tabs, support for regular expressions, macros etc.

As I was working on a project this morning, it occurred to me that I should mention a custom syntax highlighting style called <a href="http://3276.hu/project/port_of_ruby_blue.html">Ruby Blue</a> that I’ve been using (image above, courtesy of the author). It’s quite surprising how beneficial a good font and syntax highlighting scheme can be, and <a href="http://3276.hu/project/port_of_ruby_blue.html">Ruby Blue,</a> coupled with <a href="http://dejavu.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">DejaVu Sans Mono</a> or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=22e69ae4-7e40-4807-8a86-b3d36fab68d3&amp;displaylang=en">Consolas,</a> works very well for me.

The Ruby Blue style is also <a href="http://wiseheartdesign.com/2006/3/11/ruby-blue-textmate-theme/">available for Vim and TextMate.</a>

Do you have a favorite text editor, monospace font, and syntax highlighting scheme?
