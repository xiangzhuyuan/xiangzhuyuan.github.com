How many roads must a man walk down 

Before they call him a man 

How many seas must a white dove sail 

Before she sleeps in the sand 

How many times must the cannonballs fly 

Before they are forever banned 

The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind 

The answer is blowing in the wind 

How many years can a mountain exist 

Before it is washed to the sea 

How many years can some people exist 

Before they’re allowed to be free 

How many times can a man turn his head 

And pretend that he just doesn’t see 

The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind 

The answer is blowing in the wind

何时我才能够成为男子汉?  
我要走多久?  
我要默默地在黑夜燃尽多少寂寞~  
怎么过都是一天,可是我却无能为力面对这些现实中的现实.  
我需要的是什么?  
我还要走多久呢?  
经历多少折腾与被折腾?  
时间不会停止,而我也无法停止向前.  
我需要为我的梦想前进每一小步…  
Be a man!~  
总是在告诫自己一些东西,而这些都已经深深地刻在我的灵魂.  
我还需要走多久,或许我才刚上路.
